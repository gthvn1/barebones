# Notes

## Memory
- Some functions related to memory are not provided by default when building `compiler_builtins` because
they are provided by the standard library and we avoid name collision. This is the case for `memset`,
`memcpy` or `memcmp`. However we are now building our binary without the standard library so we can
implement these functions (and maybe introduce bug) or enable their compilation. We choose the second
option.

## Build
- As we are building our own target we must also build the "core" and "compiler_builtins" crates. We don't have standard library but we need core and builtins.
  - This is done by adding `.cargo/config.toml` file
  - We also need to have rust source code:
    - `rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- To build:
